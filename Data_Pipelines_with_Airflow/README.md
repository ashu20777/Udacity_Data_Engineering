# Project: Data Pipelines with Airflow

## Introduction

A music streaming company, Sparkify, has decided that it is time to introduce more automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines and come to the conclusion that the best tool to achieve this is Apache Airflow.

The source data resides in S3 and needs to be processed in Sparkify's data warehouse in Amazon Redshift. The source datasets consist of JSON logs that tell about user activity in the application and JSON metadata about the songs the users listen to.

In this project we build a high grade data pipeline that is dynamic and built from reusable tasks, can be monitored, and allows easy backfills.


## Project structure

The files found at this project are the following:

- dl.cfg: Config file with AWS credentials.
- etl.py: Program that extracts songs and log data from S3, transforms it using Spark, and loads the Fact and Dimension tables back to S3 in parquet format.
- data_lake.ipynb: Jupyter notebook, for running the program on Jupyter instead of the command line. In order to run, import this notebook on the EMR cluster.
- README.md: Current file, contains detailed information about the project.

## Source Data
* Song data: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
* Log data: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`

- **Song datasets**: all json files are nested in subdirectories under *s3a://udacity-dend/song_data*. A sample of this files is:

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

- **Log datasets**: all json files are nested in subdirectories under *s3a://udacity-dend/log_data*. A sample of a single row of each files is:

```
{"artist":"Slipknot","auth":"Logged In","firstName":"Aiden","gender":"M","itemInSession":0,"lastName":"Ramirez","length":192.57424,"level":"paid","location":"New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA","method":"PUT","page":"NextSong","registration":1540283578796.0,"sessionId":19,"song":"Opium Of The People (Album Version)","status":200,"ts":1541639510796,"userAgent":"\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/36.0.1985.143 Safari\/537.36\"","userId":"20"}
```

## Data Warehouse design
    #### Fact Table
	 **songplays**  - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page  `NextSong`
    -   _songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent_

	#### Dimension Tables
	 **users**  - users in the app
		Fields -   _user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level_
		
	 **songs**  - songs in music database
    Fields - _song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration_
    
	**artists**  - artists in music database
    Fields -   _artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude_
    
	  **time**  - timestamps of records in  **songplays**  broken down into specific units
    Fields -   _start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday_
