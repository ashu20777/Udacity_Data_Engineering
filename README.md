# Data Engineering Projects

## Project 1: Data Modeling with Postgres
In this project, we model user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. We create a relational database and ETL pipeline designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to. We define Fact and Dimension tables in PostgreSQL and insert data into the new tables.

## Project 2: Data Modeling with Cassandra
In this project, we model user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. We create a noSQL database and ETL pipeline designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to. We model your data in Apache Cassandra to allow for specific queries provided by the analytics team at Sparkify.

## Project 3: Build a Cloud Data Warehouse
In this project, we build an ETL pipeline that extracts data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms the data into a set of dimensional tables for the analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

## Project 4: Build a Data Lake
In this project, we build an ETL pipeline for a data lake. The data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in the app. We load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3. We deploy this Spark process on a cluster using AWS.

## Project 5: Data Pipelines with Airflow
In this project, we continue your work on the music streaming companyâ€™s data infrastructure by creating and automating a set of data pipelines. We configure and schedule data pipelines with Airflow and monitor and debug production pipelines.

## Project 6: CAPSTONE PROJECT
In this project we use the knowledge gained in this program to build our own data warehouse. We define the scope of the project and the data we are working with. We gather data from several different data sources; transform, combine, and summarize it; and create a clean data warehouse for others to analyze.
