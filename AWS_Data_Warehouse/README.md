# AWS Datawarehouse

## Project description

Sparkify is a music streaming startup with a growing user base and song database.

Their user activity and songs metadata data resides in json files in S3. The goal of the current project is to build an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of fact and dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. 

## How to run

1. Add the information needed below to connect to the Redshift Cluster and database, and save it as *dwh.cfg* in the project root folder.

```
[CLUSTER]
HOST=''
DB_NAME=''
DB_USER=''
DB_PASSWORD=''
DB_PORT=5439

[IAM_ROLE]
ARN=

[S3]
LOG_DATA='s3://udacity-dend/log_data'
LOG_JSONPATH='s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json'
SONG_DATA='s3://udacity-dend/song_data'

[AWS]
KEY=
SECRET=

[DWH]
DWH_CLUSTER_TYPE       = multi-node
DWH_NUM_NODES          = 4
DWH_NODE_TYPE          = dc2.large
DWH_CLUSTER_IDENTIFIER = 
DWH_DB                 = 
DWH_DB_USER            = 
DWH_DB_PASSWORD        = 
DWH_PORT               = 5439
DWH_IAM_ROLE_NAME      = 
```

2. Run the below script to create and connect to a Redshift Cluser:

    `$ python create_cluster.py`

3. Run the below script to set up the Redshift database:

    `$ python create_tables.py`

4. Finally, run the script to load data from S3 to the staging tables in Redshift, and then laod the fact and dimensional tables from the staging tables.

    `$ python etl.py`


## Database schema design
Below are the names and description of the Datawarehouse tables:

#### Staging Tables
- stg_events
- stg_songs

####  Fact Table
- songplays - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong - 
*songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent*

#### Dimension Tables
- users - users in the app - 
*user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level*
- songs - songs in music database - 
*song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration*
- artists - artists in music database - 
*artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude*
- time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units - 
*start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday*
